We had a lot of trouble with the emulator in Android Studio, of the 4 computers we tried it only worked on one of them.
Towards the end of this project, the emulator that was working also stopped. Creating a new emulator didn't help either.
We spent 16 hours or so trying our best to get the emulators to work, we tried every solution on the internett, some examples are:

This is why there is only one contributor on the project, since we worked from one computer.
Towards the end we did not have any way to check if our project was running properly.
We hope you can review our code, and not just look at the fact if the application is running or not.
